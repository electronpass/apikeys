# Retrieving your own credentials

For obvious reasons you can't use our credentials, but you can allways create your own. To do that, refer to the following guides:

### Google Drive
- Go to [Google API Console](https://console.developer.google.com) and create new project.
- Under ```Credentials``` create new ```OAuth client ID```.
- Enable ```Google Drive API``` under ```Dashboard```.
